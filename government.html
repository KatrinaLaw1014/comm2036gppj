    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">At the end of March 2019, He Jian, former Standing Committee member and former secretary of the Political and Legal Committee of Honghe Prefecture of Yunnan Province, who had attracted public attention for "spreading political rumors and falsely accusing the Secretary of the Party Committee of Honghe Prefecture of Yunnan Province", was prosecuted according to law. From October 2017 to May 2018, because He Jian was dissatisfied with some leading cadres in Honghe Prefecture, He used other people's identity information to purchase two mobile phone cards and sent dozens of anonymous text messages to create, spread and spread political rumors among leading cadres. He Jian confessed in the review that the content of the text message was fabricated by hearsay and his personal analysis, and had not been verified; The purpose of sending short messages is to destroy the trust and unity between leaders, so that they can mistrust each other and even be dealt with by the organization.</p>
