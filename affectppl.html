    <h2>Fake news affects you easily</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;"><img style="width: 300px;height: 300px;float: right;" src="https://www.esafety.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-06/Fake%20news_0.svg">Fake news have become a problem in different countries and the reason why this issue has attracted attention is of course because people are generally worried that fake news may have various negative impacts on society. However, as long as the news media still plays the role of gatekeeper to a certain extent, and society works on media literacy education and fact-checking, it is still unknown whether the negative impact of false information is actually very large.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Interestingly, regardless of the actual impact of disinformation, people may tend to believe that they are not too affected by it, but at the same time believe that others will be affected. In communication research, this is called the "third person effect"</p> 
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Phenomenon: when people are asked whether they will be affected by media content, many people tend to say "no"; but when people are asked whether other people in society will be affected, many people tend to say "yes".</p>

        <h1 style="border-left: 6px solid rgb(255, 158, 30); background-color: lightgray;">The Third-Person Effect</h1>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.5;">
          <li>Definition: People tend to perceive that mass media messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal biases.</li>
          <li>Reason: People have the awareness of maintaining self-image, they feel better if they think others are more easily affected by media than themselves.</li>
          <li>Factors: Judgements of message desirability and perceived social distance</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Relationship between the Third-Person Effect and Government Controlling Fake News</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The Third-person effect obviously affected the public’s belief that fake news needs to be regulated, by which was meant that the spread of fake news would affect the judgment of “other” citizens on public affairs. For this reason, people hoped that the government would regulate the fake news, but considered that the spread of fake news would affect “self” judgments on public affairs and would not support the regulation of fake news.</p>
