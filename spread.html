    <h2>Who spread out misinformation?</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"><img src="https://cheshirelibraryblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/screenshot-2020-10-10-123718.png" style="float:right;width:200px;height:150px;">
      Have you ever thought about who create fake news or spread out misinformation? Does media do it? Actually, everyone can be the one who create news since it is more easier than you think.</p>
    <h1 style="border-left: 6px solid rgb(255, 158, 30); background-color: lightgray;">Steps of Creating a Fake News</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating a fake news site
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Create a website on which the fake news stories will be presented, or hosted. This requires two things, a domain name for the website and the host of the website itself. Each of these can be bought relatively cheaply, and both can be designed to look as much like legitimate news sites as possible.</p></li>
        <li>Stealing content
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The most common place that fake news site owners steal from is satire websites or from sensationalistic “clickbait.” Satire websites like The Onion or Clickhole often post outrageous news parodies, and those who visit these satire sites know not to believe them.</p></li>
      <li>Selling advertising
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">One motivation for fake news site owners is earning money from these websites. Advertising is the process through which they do this. The owners of these sites can make a small amount of money for each visitor to one of their webpages, and a slightly larger amount every time a visitor clicks on an advertisement on the page.</p></li> 
      <li>Spreading via social media
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Social media platforms inherently benefit from fake news because shocking, sensationalizing, and popular posts keep users engaged. Anything sensational draws readers in, and things that are untrue tend to be sensational.</p></li> 
      <li>Repeat
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The fake news factory model is so successful because it can be easily replicated, streamlined, and requires very little expertise to operate. Clicks and attention are all that matter, provided you can get the right domain name, hosting service, stolen content, and social media spread.</p></li>

            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Media may not the only role who spread  rumors, fake news, misinformation or disinformation. The person that next to you may also create fake content on social media.</p>
